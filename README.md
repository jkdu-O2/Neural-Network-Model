# Neural Network for XOR Problem

## Overview
This repository contains a simple feedforward neural network implemented using NumPy to solve the XOR problem. The network is designed to be lightweight, easy to understand, and customizable. It includes:

- Configurable number of hidden layers  
- Sigmoid activation function  
- Forward and backward propagation  
- Gradient descent optimization  

This project is ideal for learning the basics of neural networks and how they can be applied to solve simple logical problems like XOR.
